# projectBeatkids
This project has the objective to increase interest in technology in primary education by collecting data to understand about the student’s learning process.

Firstly, it was designed and created a device for the development of computational thinking using sequential and repetitive elements of musical creations to teach programming. That part was made by Garazi Onandia Loroño.

Now, the main objective is design and create an attractive, simple and easy interface to communicate and interact with the students. That part will be made by me, Layssa Alves Pacheco.

The toy has an illuminated keyboard with 32 buttons which size and complexity is adapted to primary education students as well as an TFT touch screen shield to interact and guide. The main element is an Arduino board, for its great importance in education, diversity and adaptability.

**proyectoEntero: This is Garazi's project, so it's the origin project.**

**nuevoProyectoEntero: This is the first version. The repetition is based in the light, so one button can turn on more than once.**

**secondVersion: This is the second version. The repetition is based in the sound, so one button can't turn on more than once.**
